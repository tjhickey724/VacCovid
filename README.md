# VacCovid
This project provides some utilities for accessing Covid 19 data from the John Hopkins University CovidTracking project.
We also have a Jupyter notebook that provides some graphs which will be useful in tracking the progress of the US toward
herd immunity for Covid19.

To run this notebook, install python 3+ and the jupyter package and give the command
``` python
python3 -m jupyter lab
```
on a Mac.  On a PC, use python instead of python3.
